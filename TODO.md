# Main stuff

-   Add grid options to query params (maybe local storage too?)
-   Remove controller/joystick controls?

# Possible small additions

-   Export resolution options

# Bigger scope stuff

-   Add "hotlist" of places
-   Add items to map (not sure about this one)
-   Enemy token creator (NPC top-down export)

# Done!

-   Remove perspective camera setting (and camera settings entirely probably)
-   Click and drag moves map
-   Limit pitch/yaw -- no pitch changes, yaw only in 90deg increments
-   remove perspective, pitch, yaw, maybe camera Y, (maybe more?) from url query params (MapViewer)
-   Scroll zooms
-   Overlay grid
-   Dashed lines
-   Remove roofs and set current floor
-   (I think done) Restrict width options (and other ints?)
-   Strip out extraneous options (need to identify all options)
